This is a project to read the GPS coordinates from a Waveshare GPS HAT.
The program runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, though it will probably also run on other platforms.
It sets the GPS chip in to 10Hz mode, and logs coordinates at 10Hz, to file.
If the vehicle stops, the recording stops, and automatically restarts when the vehicle restarts.
